# Group Assignment

## Overview

Group Assignment is a project focused on developing an operating system with a command-line interpreter (CLI), advanced display capabilities, and an interactive game. The project features a CLI with command history and auto-completion, as well as a visual display of team members' names and a short video. Additionally, it includes a Sokuban game with communication and logging features.

## Features

### Command Line Interpreter (CLI)
- **OS Name Display**: Shows a persistent OS name (e.g., MyOS) as the prompt in the console.
- **Auto-Completion**: Enables command and option auto-completion using the TAB key.
- **Command History**: Allows browsing of command history with `_` (up arrow) and `+` (down arrow) keys.
- **Character Deletion**: Supports character deletion while typing without overwriting the OS name.

### Display Features
- **Text and Background Image**: Displays the names of all team members over a custom background image with different colors and fonts.
- **Video Display**: Shows a short video (e.g., RMIT campus scene) on the screen.

### Game - Sokuban
- **Colorful Game**: Implements a Sokuban game with at least one stage, and optionally additional stages.
- **Game Controls**: Communicates with the CLI terminal for game control, providing ACK/NAK responses.
- **Data Logging**: Logs interactions, including the number of commands received and other useful data.
